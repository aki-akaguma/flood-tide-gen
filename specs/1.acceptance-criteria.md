# Acceptance Criteria (EARS)

## Input Parsing

- **UBC-1 (Ubiquitous):** While the system is running, it shall be able to parse a text-based command-line interface definition file.
- **SC-1 (State-driven):** When the input file contains a short option (e.g., `-h`), the system shall correctly parse it.
- **SC-2 (State-driven):** When the input file contains a long option (e.g., `--help`), the system shall correctly parse it.
- **SC-3 (State-driven):** When an option in the input file has an argument (e.g., `<file>`), the system shall associate the argument with the option.
- **SC-4 (State-driven):** When an option is a flag (no argument), the system shall recognize it as such.

## Code Generation

- **EBC-1 (Event-driven):** When the parsing is complete, the system shall generate a "Help Source" file containing data structures for the CLI options.
- **EBC-2 (Event-driven):** When the parsing is complete, the system shall generate a "Match Source" file that maps parsed options to their corresponding configuration fields.

## Type Customization

- **FC-1 (Feature-driven):** Where the user specifies a `Vec<T>` for an option, the system shall collect multiple values for that option into a vector.
- **FC-2 (Feature-driven):** Where the user specifies an `Option<T>`, the system shall make the option's value optional.
- **FC-3 (Feature-driven):** Where the user specifies a primitive type (e.g., `i32`), the system shall parse the option's argument into that type.
- **FC-4 (Feature-driven):** Where the user provides a custom type implementing `FromStr`, the system shall use it to parse the option's argument.

## Subcommand Support

- **FC-5 (Feature-driven):** Where the CLI structure is a simple command, the system shall generate code for a single-level command structure.
- **FC-6 (Feature-driven):** Where the CLI structure involves a parent command, the system shall generate code that supports subcommands.
- **FC-7 (Feature-driven):** Where the CLI structure is a subcommand, the system shall generate code that integrates with a parent command.

## File Handling

- **UC-1 (Unwanted-condition):** If the generated code is identical to the existing file content, the system shall not write to the file.

## Non-Functional

- **UBC-2 (Ubiquitous):** The system shall be compatible with Rust 1.56.0 and newer.
- **UBC-3 (Ubiquitous):** The system shall use the 2021 Rust edition.
